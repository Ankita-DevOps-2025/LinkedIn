DevOps Engineer Interview at Tesla ⚡

Round 1 – Systems Reliability, Edge Compute & Observability at Tesla Scale
1. A Tesla service depends on Kafka + Redis. Both look healthy but requests are intermittently failing. What’s your debug path before escalating to app teams?
2. Walk me through how you’d design a secure CI/CD pipeline that pushes code to both cloud and on-prem edge environments.
3. How would you debug a pod stuck in “ContainerCreating” during deployment? What are your next 3 CLI commands?
4. You see a gradual increase in latency across an NGINX ingress, but CPU/memory are stable. What’s your next move?
5. What’s your approach to handling secrets rotation in Kubernetes and CI/CD environments?
6. Describe how you’d build centralized logging across edge nodes, factory servers, and cloud instances.

Round 2 – Incident Simulation, RCA & Energy Grid Fire Drills
1. A new firmware build pipeline starts failing during artifact uploads. S3 shows no error, Jenkins logs are incomplete. Where do you start?
2. You deployed a Cilium update, and suddenly inter-pod communication breaks for one namespace. What’s your triage approach to confirm root cause?
3. 30% of Tesla Superchargers in Europe report “backend unavailable”, but cloud dashboards show all green. How would you isolate whether it’s DNS, TLS, or routing drift?
4. A TensorRT container for AI inference starts throttling GPU utilization from 90% → 20%. What system-level checks do you run before blaming drivers?
5. You notice Terraform apply suddenly creating duplicate resources in one environment. What’s your rollback + drift correction approach?

Round 3 – Leadership, Reliability Culture & Innovation DNA
1. Tesla infra spans manufacturing, energy, and vehicle telemetry, how would you define SLOs that make sense across such different systems?
2. When engineers ship daily, how do you enforce release confidence without slowing down innovation?
3. You’re tasked with introducing chaos testing for edge clusters, how do you scope risk boundaries?
4. What’s your approach to mentoring DevOps engineers to think systemically, not syntactically?

💡 TL;DR:
If you’ve never:
1. Debugged inter-pod CNI failures after a config change
2. Fixed a Jenkins–S3 artifact sync under pressure
3. Designed multi-region CI/CD for edge + cloud
4. Defined real SLOs beyond “CPU < 80%”
Then Tesla interviews won’t just test your tools, they’ll test your judgment under chaos.
