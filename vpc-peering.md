Understanding VPC Peering: Secure Private Connections
In AWS, Virtual Private Clouds (VPCs) provide isolated network environments. But what happens when resources in different VPCs need to communicate privately? Enter VPC Peering.
What is VPC Peering?
VPC Peering creates a direct, private network connection between two VPCs. This allows instances in one VPC to communicate with instances in the other VPC as if they were on the same network, using private IP addresses.
Key characteristics:
Private Connectivity: Traffic stays within the AWS network and never traverses the public internet.
Same/Different Accounts & Regions: Peering can connect VPCs across different AWS accounts and even different AWS regions (Cross-Region VPC Peering).
Non-Overlapping CIDRs: A critical requirement is that the IP address ranges (CIDR blocks) of the two VPCs must not overlap.
How It Works:
Request & Accept: One VPC owner requests a peering connection, and the other accepts it.
Route Table Updates: You must manually update the route tables in both VPCs to direct traffic destined for the peer VPC's CIDR block to the peering connection.
Security Group/NACLs: Configure your security groups and Network ACLs to allow the desired traffic flow between the peered VPCs.
Benefits:
Enhanced Security: Data remains private on the AWS backbone.
Reduced Latency: Direct network path within AWS for faster communication.
Cost-Effective: Often cheaper than routing traffic over the public internet.
Simplified Networking: Avoids complex VPN setups for VPC-to-VPC communication.
Important Limitation: No Transitive Routing
VPC Peering is a non-transitive connection. If VPC A peers with VPC B, and VPC B peers with VPC C, VPC A cannot directly communicate with VPC C through VPC B. For highly interconnected or complex networks, AWS Transit Gateway is a more scalable alternative.
Use VPC Peering for straightforward, one-to-one VPC connections where direct private communication is needed.
