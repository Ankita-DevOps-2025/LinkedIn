If you work with Kubernetes, you should know why Ingress isn’t enough anymore ~ and what Gateway API fixes.

Whether you’re a Cloud Engineer, DevOps Engineer, or Platform Admin, here’s a step-by-step breakdown of both..
and how traffic actually flows..

**Ingress Flow
Client Request:
↳ A user request first hits a cloud load balancer created by the Ingress Controller.

Ingress Controller Pod:
↳ Manages routing and applies the rules defined in the Ingress resource (NGINX, GKE Ingress, etc.).

Ingress Resource:
↳ Defines routing paths for incoming requests - which service or path to send traffic to.

Service (ClusterIP / NodePort):
↳ Connects routing rules to the actual app inside the cluster.

Pods (Applications):
↳ The final destination ~ where containers handle the request.

In short:
Ingress offers a simpler, single-layer model.. one resource manages routing and load balancing inside the cluster.
------------

*Gateway Flow
Client Request:
↳ Traffic enters through a cloud load balancer (AWS, GCP, Azure) — managed by the Gateway Controller.

Gateway Controller Pod:
↳ Handles all Gateway configurations and keeps them in sync (Istio / Envoy / Cilium).

GatewayClass (Infra Provider):
↳ Created by infra teams ~ defines how Gateways are implemented in the cluster.

Gateway (Cluster Admin):
↳ Created by cluster admins; sets up listeners, TLS, and entry points for traffic.

HTTPRoutes (Developers):
↳ Created by app teams; define where traffic should go (to which services or namespaces).

In short:
Gateway splits responsibilities ~ infra teams handle setup, admins handle routing, and developers handle app paths.

So all in all ~ Gateway provides:
→ More structure: clear separation of roles .
→ More flexibility: supports multiple implementations (Istio, Envoy, Cilium) without rewriting manifests.
→ More consistency: a standardized API across clusters & cloud.

Hope this helps clarify the evolution from Ingress to Gateway ~
and why the shift matters as clusters scale.
